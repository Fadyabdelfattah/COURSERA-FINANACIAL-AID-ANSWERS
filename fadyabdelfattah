          My name is fady abdelfattah 25 years old im from Egypt I didn’t finish my senior year in college due financial problems, I used to work as store  keeper assistant for ‘i-copack’ company I used work there for one year, I also used to work as hairdresser in big salon   for one year,
But I didn’t stay a lot in these jobs cuz her in Egypt you get fired for unreasonable reasons that’s what made me interested in nursing I find it as a good job and will benefit me financial and will be a great opportunity to emigrate to Canada to start a new life and get a better a  opportunity there .therefore I would like to start studying nursing to help people out and help myself also to have a better life. Also I thought this is a great opportunity to start studying online courses due to the covid-19 virus (corona). I think ill get more benefit learning new things and having a new opportunity  to start my life journey again
